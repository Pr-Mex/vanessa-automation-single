## Main settings

   * **featurepath**:
      The directory of feature files or the name of a single feature file that will be executed during the testing session.

*  Filter by tags

      * **ignoretags**:

      * **filtertags**:
         Enter tags in the field. If the tag is NOT detected in the feature, the whole feature will not be uploaded. You can also upload only the feature scenarios, which contain the tags from the list.

*  Scenario filter

      * **scenariofilter**:
         Allows you to set the order in which scripts are executed. The scripts will be executed in the order they are listed.
         Plus allows you to set a filter for executing scripts. Only scripts from the list will be executed.
         The script in the list is indicated by its name.

*  Feature file language

         If the checkbox is on, data for translation into another language will be added when clicking the scenario step by step.

      * **searchformelementsbyname**:
         If the flag is set, then when generating the script text after pasting, the steps in the script will search for form elements by their internal name.
         If the flag is unchecked, then when generating the script text after being pasted, the steps in the script will search for form elements by title, if possible.
         This is possible if there is only one element with the given heading in the given form.

      * **ShowWindowToStopRecordingUserActions**:
         Enables the display of an additional window for conveniently stopping the recording of user actions and switching to the Vanessa Automation window. You must enable the use of the VanessaExt component.

*  External component VanessaExt

      * **useaddine**:
         Designed to manage Windows and Linux windows.
         Possibilities:
         Getting a list of windows and a list of processes
         Controlling the size and position of the window
         Taking a screenshot of a window and a screenshot
         https://github.com/lintest/VanessaExt

      * **usethegherkinparserfromthevanessaextaddin**:

*  System settings

      * **thetreetagisenabledbydefault**:
         If the checkbox is on, feature file is considered as if it has @tree tag, even if it is absent. In other words, any uploaded feature file is considered as hierarchical.

      * **EvaluateExpressionsInCurlyBraces**:
         Turns on the mode when any expression inside the parameters of the steps {} will be evaluated. If the section "Variables" is declared, but first an attempt will be made to find a variable from this section by the specified expression. Otherwise, an attempt will be made to evaluate the expression in {}.
         If {expression} is used, then the expression will be evaluated on the client.
         If {!expression} Is used, the expression will be evaluated on the server.

*  Other settings

      * **DownloadFeaturesOpen**:
         Allows you to control the behavior of Vanessa Automation when opening: do you need to upload a feature file with which the work was carried out in the previous session or not.

      * **DetermineTheRealPortOnWhichTheTestingClientWasLaunched**:
         If this option is enabled, then when the testing client connects, an attempt will be made to determine the real port on which the testing client was launched.
         It is necessary. since the testing client can change the port on which it started, despite the passed parameters.
         This issue is relevant when running tests on Linux.

*  Closing test client

      * **forceclosetestclient**:
         If the flag is set, then when closing the testing client, it will be checked whether the testing client has closed by its PID. If the testing client has not closed normally, an attempt will be made to close it using the OS command.

         The number of seconds to check that the testing client process completed on its own.

*  Mobile client

      * **PathToadb**:

      * **soundnotificationwhenscriptends**:
         If this option is enabled, the following sound notification will be issued at the end of the script execution:
                 1. Scripts completed successfully.
                 2. An error occurred while executing the script.
                 3. The breakpoint was triggered.
         You must enable the use of the VanessaExt addin.
         This option only works under Windows.

*  Script execution speed

      * **makestepsasync**:
         If the checkbox is on, each step will be executed asynchronously with the specified delay.
         If the checkbox is off, the steps will be executed synchronously. Steps tree will be updated on each 100th step.
         Scenario runs several times faster when the flag is off.

      * **SpacingStepSpecifiedUser**:
         Specifies delay between steps in asynchronous mode.

         Specifies the maximum time to wait for an asynchronous step.
         For example, if the parameter value is set to 20 seconds and the step is used
         ```Gherkin
         And I wait the field named "FieldName" will be filled in 10 seconds
         ```
         then in reality the maximum step time will be 20 seconds, not 10.

      * **safeexecutionofsteps**:
         Adds delay for multiple actions, which may cause unstable scenario execution, e.g.: move to line, field value check etc.
         This option slow the execution down .

         Actual when working in the step tree mode.

*  Script statuses

      * **pendingequalfailed**:
         If the checkbox is on, pending steps will set assembly status to failed on the execution on CI server.
         It is recommended to set this checkbox on.

      * **distinguishbrokenorfailedbythenkeyword**:
         If the checkbox is on, assembly status will be set to Failed only if failing step starts with Then keyword. In all other cases - Broken. This helps distinguish broken tests from real configuration errors.

*  Other script execution settings

         It is recommended to set this checkbox on.

      * **updateformtableswhengettingvalue**:
         If this option is enabled, then when receiving a table, the test will try to find and click on the "Refresh" table button and press it.
