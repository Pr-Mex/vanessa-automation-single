* Hi! In this lesson, I will tell you about what auto-documentation is. Let's open the second copy of Vanessa in training mode.
		И я открываю Vanessa Automation в режиме обучения

* The ability to create auto-documentation is an additional feature of the Vanessa Automation framework.
* Since the scripts are mostly executed in the test Manager and Test Client mode, the script execution process is clearly visible on the screen.
* Fields are being filled on, buttons pressed, documents created and posted, and so on.
* In addition, the scripts are written in the human-readable Gherkin language.
* Summarizing the above, it would be nice to somehow record what is happening on the screen, retaining its meaning.
* That's how the idea of auto-documentation appeared.
* Auto-documentation can be created in text format - in fact, it is a sequence of screenshots of the screen and text.
* Also, auto-documentation can be formed as video files with screen actions voiceover.
* A separate type of auto-documentation is the interactive help that you are currently looking at.
* But behind each type of auto-documentation there is a script in the Gherkin language, which is run in Vanessa Automation with certain settings.
* To dive deeper into the topic of auto-documentation, follow this link.
		И я загружаю фичи в VA в режиме обучения "$КаталогИнструментов$\training\features_en\Примеры\ПримерАвтоинструкцииОбзорВозможностей.feature"
		И Я делаю подсветку текста в редакторе VA в режиме обучения с 8 по 8 строку 'To get acquainted with the topic - start with this' подсценарий

* That's it, move on to the next lesson of the interactive help.
