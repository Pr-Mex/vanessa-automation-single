Сценарий: Что такое язык Gherkin?

* Hi! In this lesson, I will tell you about what the Gherkin language is.

* Look. Gherkin is a very simple programming or test scripting language. It differs from other languages ​​in that it is a human-readable language.

* In other words, a program in the Gherkin language is a sequence of simple steps that are combined into scripts, and they are combined into features.

* Initially, the Gherkin language was invented as an implementation of the Behavior-driven development, or BDD for short.

* An important point: Vanessa Automation testing framework uses its own, extended version of the Gherkin language, which is correctly called Turbo Gherkin.

* It supports such language constructs as calling subscripts, using conditions and loops, using variables, and so on.

* When writing test scripts using Vanessa Automation, you don't necessarily have to follow the BDD methodology. You decide to what extent to apply this methodology, including whether it can be completely unused.

* That's it, move on to the next lesson of the interactive help.
